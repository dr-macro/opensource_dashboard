# opensource_dashboard

## Aims

* Help me find a relevant package by 'NLP' to define topics/categories (e.g. all the table packages, or all ADaM packages)
* Help me find 'similar' packages to one of interest
* Help me understand more about this package (e.g. OS health, riskmetric scores, who works on it)
* Help people discover where they could contribute to packages (e.g. open issues)

The following project is trying to define the final scope: https://github.com/openpharma/opensource_dashboard/projects/1
